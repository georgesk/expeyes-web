    <p>Pricing:<br/>
      The development ExpEYES is done by Inter-University Accelerator Centre,
      New Delhi. Since the objective of PHOENIX project is to make the products
      available to maximum number of people, they  are kept royalty-free.
      The cost of expEYES is depends on the cost of raw materials, labour
      involved, and the sales overheads. The vendors have fixed the Maximum
      Retail Price considering the expenses and paperwork involved in securing
      orders and the delay in payments from institutions. However, they will
      offer discount when payment is done in advance so that individual buyers
      get it cheaper.</p>
    <p>Currently ExpEYES Junior is available at  Rs. 2000/- and 
      MicroHOPE at Rs. 700/-<br/>
      <br/>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Reaching out to more People:</span><br/>
          ExpEYES is designed by IUAC and it is distributed
      royalty-free. The software is under GNU GPL. Anybody interested in
      retailing / manufacture expEYES may contact us. In order ensure quality of
      the product and user support, the vendors need to meet the following
      conditions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>    One sample piece has to be certified by IUAC for
        quality of material and workmanship.</li>
      <li>    The prototype approved by IUAC should be duplicated
        without changes</li>
      <li>    Vendor should inform IUAC about the sales so that
        we can keep track of the user community.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>     Currently expEYES is available from several
      vendors. However, it would be convenient if it is available from a local
      store, especially for institution that cannot order online by making
      advance payment. One option is to ask some computer vendor in your
      locality to become a dealer of expEYES. They will be able to sell at the
      same price by getting commission from the manufacturers.</p>
