    <div id="node-top" class="node-top region nested"> </div>
    <p><span style="font-size:14px;">Nov-2011: expEYS was released in Mar-2011
        and is doing reasonably well. There was no plan to develop another
        version.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:14px;">6-Nov-2011 : <a href="http://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/%7Eprabhu/">Prabhu</a>,s
        mail ..Looking forward to seeing you at <a href="http://scipy.in/scipyin/2011/talks-cfp/speakers/">SciPy.in
          2011</a>.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:14px;">4-Dec-2011 : <a href="http://urtalk.kpoint.in/playlist/43/kapsule/gcc-b73217cf-469a-4c52-ad22-e2c40c88bd5d">Gave
          a demo</a> of expEYES at Scipy.in 2011</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:14px;">5-Dec-2011 : Met <a href="http://www.che.iitb.ac.in/online/node/52">Prof.
          Kannan Moudgalya</a> and gave a demo expEYES.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:14px;">9-Dec-2011 : Prof. Kannan arranged meeting
        with N K Sinha, Director of NMEICT project, MHRD. Talked about the
        possibility of using expEYES with the Akash tablet PC. Shri Sinha wanted
        something costing only few hundred rupees. Also gave a demo at their
        committee meeting. Submitted a proposal to NMEICT for some human
        resource to conduct expEYES training programs and attended meeting on
        26-Dec-11.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:14px;">Even though no Android version of expEYES
        made, the<strong> idea of a very low cost device</strong> came up. I
        decided to explore the options for lowering the cost further. A design
        using Atmega328, from Atmel Corp., was made, using built-in 10 bit ADC
        and PWM DAC. PCB size reduced to 9mm x6 mm</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:14px;">29-Dec-11 : PCB sent for fabrication.&nbsp;
      </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:14px;">3-Jan-12 : Sent another version of PCB for
        fabrication. To reduce size, it replaced TC7660&nbsp; with TC1240A
        voltage doubler.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:14px;">12-Jan-12 : Went back to TC7660 since one
        of the TC1240A failed during continuous testing, keeping both versions.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:14px;">Tested by writing the required C and Python
        programs, like CRO. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:14px;"><img src="images/proto-trial2.jpg" style="width: 450px; height: 232px;"></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:14px;">Started looking for micro-controllers with
        built-in USB, 12bit ADC and 2k RAM. Found PIC18F2458, from Microchip
        Inc., having both. After contacting Microchip, it was realised that the
        built-in USB cannot be used simultaneously with the real-time
        measurements required. Changed to PIC18F25KA80 + MCP2200 combination.
        Vinod &amp; Pramode did ADC &amp; UART testing of PIC18F2458. Almost
        decided to go for a PIC controller.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:14px;">29-Jan-12 : Sent the PIC based PCB for
        fabrication. The memory bank switching found too slow for C code filling
        large arrays. The uC architecture doesn't&nbsp; look very C compiler
        friendly. Searched, with inputs from Pramode CE,&nbsp; for a 16 bit
        version satisfying the requirements, found PIC24FV32KA302. Supported by
        gcc.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:14px;">31-Jan-12 : Attended the Technical Training
        Seminar by Microchip. Fortunately Microchip released development tools,
        MPLABX,&nbsp; for GNU/Linux also.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:14px;">9-Feb-12 : Sent PIC24 uC based PCB for
        fabrication.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:14px;">18-Feb-12 : Received PICKIT3 programmer and
        PIC24FV32KA302 chips. Surface mount package was ordered by mistake,
        instead of DIP, but tested them using PICKIT3 somehow. Started testing
        the PCB from the beginning of Mar-12, facing problems mostly due to lack
        of familiarity with PIC uCs. Thanks to the cooperation from Microchip
        things are getting sorted out. Solving a UART error took days, to
        realize that the watchdog timer is enabled by default.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:14px;">13-Mar-12: Transmitted 1 million blocks, of
        256bytes,&nbsp; from uC to PC without any error. ADC seems to be at par
        with the MCP3208 used in expEYES.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:14px;">20-Mar-12 : C language code failed to meet
        the 100 ksamples/sec rate for&nbsp; ADC blockread. Started learning
        PIC24 assembly language, great help from the <a href="http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/electrical-engineering/semiconductor-technology/9781584505839/introduction-to-the-pic24-microcontroller-family/ch03lev1sec5#X2ludGVybmFsX0ZsYXNoUmVhZGVyP3htbGlkPTk3ODE1ODQ1MDU4MzkvNzg=">online
          book</a> by Robert Reese, Bryan Jones and J. W. Bruce. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:14px;">26-Mar-12: With assembler code ADC
        blockread giving 250 ksample/sec sampling rate, Timer1 ISR is used.
        Tested single channel block reads by capturing and fitting sine wave.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:14px;">1-Apr-2012: Received a mail from Myra
        Vanlnwegen, education coordinator for the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry
          Pi</a> Foundation, asking whether expEYES work with Raspberry Pi.
        Requested her to send one Rpi board.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:14px;">5-Apr-12 : Time measurement routines are
        almost done. A numbering scheme is worked out to make the functions more
        generic. A CRO program is running now.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:14px;">7-Apr-12: Again some changes in hardware.
        Decided to provide only one amplifier. A digital output other that SQRs,
        all using a CMOS buffer IC. Introduced TC1240A after some continuous
        testing.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:14px;">8-Apr-12: Having trouble with Charge Time
        Measurement Unit of PIC micro. A = 5.5 uA, 48.6 uA &amp; 451 uA in 3
        different ranges, measured using DMM. With 10x CRO probe connected V
        =1.25 after&nbsp; feeding 5.5 uA for 10 usecs. Error reported but no
        solution yet.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:14px;">18-Apr-2012: The Rpi board arrived. Help
        for testing came from Alex Bradbury.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:14px;">20-Apr-2012: expEYES tested on Rpi.
        Everything is fine except a USB error that allows only keyboard or mouse
        along with expEYES. Bug report filed.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:14px;">1-May-2012: A serial port version of
        expEYES has been developed for Rpi. Communication tested between uC and
        Rpi. The PCB has been send for fabrication.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:14px;">9-May-12: Did several iterations of
        prototyping. Added a 1mA constant current source with ON/OFF control.
        Firmware almost done. Wrote a CRO program with extra features. Drawings
        of the plastic shell given for making the mould. Almost getting ready
        for production.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:14px;">16-May-12 : expEYES was announced on <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1228">Raspberry
          Pi</a> webpage. Getting resonably good feedback and enquiries about
        availability. Planning to make USB &amp; Serial version (for Rpi), both
        having almost identical layout.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:14px;">17-May-12 : Started testing and documenting
        experiments for the new model. Modifying firmare and Python code
        whereever required. Some modifications are done to the hardware also.
        Trying to reach the final PCB at the earliest.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:14px;">23-May-12: The first lot of PBCs send for
        fabrication, asked the vendor in Delhi to start making some sample
        pieces. Stopped work for two weeks, programs at JIT, Coimbatore and NIT,
        Calicut.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:14px;">7-Jun-2012: Started writing software and
        documentation. A CRO program with some extra features was done first. By
        end of June several boards were assembled. Some minor changes to the
        PCB. The read back of Square waves shifted to the after the buffer.
        Series resistors added to A1 and A2 inputs after level shifting. Got the
        plastic cabinets.</span></p>

    <p><span style="font-size:14px;">1-Jul-2012: Final PCB send for fabrication.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:14px;">16-Jul-2012: Units send to Pramode &amp;
        Georges, for testing.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:14px;">2-Aug-2012: Finished <a href="software.html">Software</a>
        and a <a href="http://expeyes.in/Documents/eyesj-a4.pdf">User Manual</a>
        describing around 50 experiments are ready. Website update and videos
        are pending.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:14px;"><a href="http://expeyes.in/articles/55/expeyes-junior">ExpEYES
          Junior</a> is ready. Photograph below shows capturing sound from a
        Piezo Buzzer.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:14px;">20-Aug-2012: First lot of commercial
        production started.</span></p>
